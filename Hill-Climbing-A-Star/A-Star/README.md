Traveling Salesman Problem using A*
===================================

Uses A* for finding a solution to the traveling salesman problem. The heuristic used is the one mentioned on the following link: http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/AI04S/project1.htm

"Cities.txt" contains test data for the problem. The algorithm is quite slow for big datasets (you can notice that the calculation of the minimum spanning tree is pretty inefficient). Also note that an optimal solution is not always found - that might be caused by some bug that I am not able to see.

Code written in Python 2.7.4.
